The URL Browser displays a single webpage within a Qt Widget for inclusion into other projects.  The source compiles into a library to link the widget into other projects.  A demo app which includes a basic QMainWindow application shows how to use the library within the main project.

### How do I get set up? ###

* make urlbrowser - to compile the library
* make demoapp - main application which embeds the library to testing purposes

### Who do I talk to? ###
